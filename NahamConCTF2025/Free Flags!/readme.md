Look at all these free flags!!  <br><br> But... wait a second... only one of them is right?? <br><br> <b>NOTE, bruteforcing flag submissions is still not permitted.</b>  I will put a "max attempts" limit on this challenge at 1:00 PM Pacific to stop participants from automating submissions. There is only one correct flag, you can find a needle in a haystack if you really know what you are looking for. <br><br> <b>Download the file(s) below.</b>
