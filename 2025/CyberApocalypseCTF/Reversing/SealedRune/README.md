## Solution 

I started by running the `strings` command on the binary, which revealed a suspicious base64-encoded string:

Decoding it gave:
`}d3l43v3r_c1g4m_3nur{BTH` si lleps terces ehT 

This looked like a reversed sentence, so I reversed the entire string that included the flag:`HTB{run3_m4g1c_r3v34l3d}`.
