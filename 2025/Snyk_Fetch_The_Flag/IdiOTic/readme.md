# IdiOTic

**Description:**

<small>Author: @HuskyHacks</small><br><br>Hey CTF players, Husky here. I'm going to abuse my station as a challenge dev and ask for a favor. I wrote an app to monitor all of my household IoT devices recently.  For some reason, I wrote it in Java (I will be taking no further questions). 
<br><br>
It would be really helpful if you all could check it out and let me know if it's secure or not. I don't anticipate anyone being able to hack into it, but you never know. Give it a shot!
