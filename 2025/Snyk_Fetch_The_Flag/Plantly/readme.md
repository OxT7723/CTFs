# Plantly

**Description:**

<small>Author: @HuskyHacks</small><br><br>We purchased a web dev project off of a gig site to build our new plant subscription service, Plantly. I think the dev was a bit rushed and made some questionable choices. Can you please pentest the app and review the source code? We need to know if there are any major issues before going live! We'll give you the source code so you can run a local instance. We also have a live dev instance so if you find any major vulnerabilities, exploit the live instance and prove it by grabbing the flag!
<br><br> The challenge source code is available in the challenge.zip folder. The password is <code>snyk-ftf-2025</code>.
<br><br> Use the Dockerfile to run a local instance of the challenge! To build and the container, unzip the contents of the challenge.zip file and run:
<br><code>docker build -t [challenge_name] . && docker run -it -p 8080:8080 [challenge_name]</code>
