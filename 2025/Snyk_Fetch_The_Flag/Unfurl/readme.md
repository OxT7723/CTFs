# Unfurl

**Description:**

<small>Author: @HuskyHacks</small><br><br>We've been working on a little side project - it's a URL unfurler! Punch in any site you'd like and you'll get the metadata, main image, the works. We're publishing it open source soon, so we figured we'd let you take a shot at testing its security first!
<br><br> The challenge source code is available in the challenge.zip folder. The password is <code>snyk-ftf-2025</code>.
<br><br> Use the Dockerfile to run a local instance of the challenge! To build and the container, unzip the contents of the challenge.zip file and run:
<br><code>docker build -t [challenge_name] . && docker run -it -p 5000:5000 [challenge_name]</code>
