## Challenge Prompt 

Want to join the party of GIFs, memes and emoji shenanigans? Or just want to ask a question for technical support regarding any challenges in the CTF? Be sure to join the Huntress CTF Discord server.

This CTF uses support tickets within Discord to help handle requests.

If you need assistance, please create a ticket with the `#ctf-open-ticket` channel. You do not need to direct message any CTF organizers or facilitators, they will just tell you to open a ticket. You might find a flag in the ticket channel, though!

## Solution
View the ctf-open-ticket channel to get the flag.
