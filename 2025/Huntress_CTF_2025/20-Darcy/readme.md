## Challenge Prompt 

Darcy has apparently been having a lot of fun with a unique version control system.

She told me she hid a flag somewhere with her new tool and wants me to find it... I can't make any sense of it, can you?

## Solution

Extracted the files from the zip and found the flag by using `grep -R 'flag'` for a flag of `flag{a0c1e852e1281d134f0ac2b8615183a3}`
