## ‚úçÔ∏è Writeup Section

The CTF challenge provided the hint: "pay attention to JavaScript and its contents."
This led me to inspect the website's source code, where I discovered the following encrypted string on the podcast page  
```
const encrypted = "U2FsdGVkX1+ASV9EBO5yBQwFFXLaKRB4SgWAZ6SKRKSy5iuQ7tGq1/tUuRm6e+TZp1Z5C9t1kUV22biCtLId/0j50x3IPcqjJqtFTOJnRNdWhxg40HXbVSXRc9ioURoW";
```

One of the clues referenced a YouTube video discussing the importance of robots.txt. Based on this, I explored the site's robots.txt file and found a path to a hidden tool at:
```
/tools/ciphertool.html
```

I used the CipherTool page and enabled the Harvest feature to generate a wordlist based on content from the psysecure.com website. 

CipherTool Configuration:
- Mode: AES Cracking
- Wordlist Options:
  - Combine two words
  - All combinations
  - Mixed case
  - Use a separator

- Encrypted Message: `U2FsdGVkX1+ASV9EBO5yBQwFFXLaKRB4SgWAZ6SKRKSy5iuQ7tGq1/tUuRm6e+TZp1Z5C9t1kUV22biCtLId/0j50x3IPcqjJqtFTOJnRNdWhxg40HXbVSXRc9ioURoW`

Password: `GhostSecret`

Decrypted Output: `https://matrix.to/#/#psysecure:matrix.org?code=GiveMeThePrize101`
