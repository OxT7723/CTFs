# TimeOff

**Description:**

<small>Author: @HuskyHacks</small><br><br>TimeOff is an early build for our upcoming line of business application that will help us manage our employee's PTO requests. Please give it a thorough security test and let us know if you find anything. To set you up for success, our devs have given you the full source code and a development build of the current app. Feel free to build a local instance for your security test. If you find anything exploitable, prove it by capturing the flag.txt file on the live instance!
<br><br> The challenge source code is available in the challenge.zip folder. The password is <code>snyk-ftf-2025</code>. 
<br><br> Use the Dockerfile to run a local instance of the challenge! To build and the container, unzip the contents of the challenge.zip file and run:
  
<br><code>docker build -t [challenge_name] . && docker run -it -p 3000:3000 [challenge_name]</code>

## Solution

Since this CTF was provided by Snyk, I started by running a Snyk security scan on the provided source code.

Snyk identified a Path Traversal vulnerability in the applicationâ€™s code, specifically in the use of `File.open`.

I created a file and input the text of ../flag.txt

Then, I attempted to download the file through the Time Off Requests page with a response of `File not found: /timeoff_app/public/uploads/../flag.txt`

I modified the input to traverse two levels up instead with `../../flag.txt`. 

Upon downloading the file to retrieve a flag of `flag{52948d88ee74b9bdab130c35c88bd406}`
