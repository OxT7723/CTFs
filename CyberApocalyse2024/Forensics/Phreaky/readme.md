# Phreaky - Forensics - medium

In the shadowed realm where the Phreaks hold sway,
A mole lurks within, leading them astray.
Sending keys to the Talents, so sly and so slick,
A network packet capture must reveal the trick.
Through data and bytes, the sleuth seeks the sign,
Decrypting messages, crossing the line.
The traitor unveiled, with nowhere to hide,
Betrayal confirmed, they'd no longer abide.
