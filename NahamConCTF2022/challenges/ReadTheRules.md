## Solution

Went to the rules page with a hint of `If you look closely, you can even find a flag on this page!`. Viewed the source of the page to find the flag in an HTML comment. 

```
<!-- Thank you for reading the rules! Your flag is: -->
<!--   flag{90bc54705794a62015369fd8e86e557b}       -->
```
