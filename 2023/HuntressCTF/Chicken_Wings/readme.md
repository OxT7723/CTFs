# Chicken Wings - warmups - easy

Author: @JohnHammond

I ordered chicken wings at the local restaurant, but uh... this really isn't what I was expecting...

Download the file(s) below [chicken_wings](chicken_wings)

## Solution  

The file contained the following text:  `♐●♋♑❀♏📁🖮🖲📂♍♏⌛🖰♐🖮📂🖰📂🖰🖰♍📁🗏🖮🖰♌📂♍📁♋🗏♌♎♍🖲♏❝` 

The symbols in the file appeared to be from the Wingdings font. 

To convert the Wingdings text back into readable characters, I used an online Wingdings translator:

 After translating the Wingdings text, I was able to extract the flag of `flag{e0791ce68f718188c0378b1c0a3bdc9e}`
