# PickleChat - Web - medium - points 498


 <small>Author: @HuskyHacks</small><br><br>Thanks for taking on this project! Our new app, PickleChat, is about to change the world. We're making encrypted comms an absolute snap! We're pretty early in development but we'd love a security assessment for our prototype.<br><br>
Please pentest our prototype application and let us know if you find any gnarly bugs.<br><br>
We don't have much in the way of documentation to provide to you, sorry! Our devs have been too busy to get that together. We're going to give you the client test suite and a few PEM files to perform the test. You'll have to infer from the code how to interact with the server. <br><br> <small>Psst... Snyk can help solve this challenge! <a href="https://snyk.co/uf6Kk">Try it out!</a></small> <br><br> <b>Press the <code>Start</code> button on the top-right to begin this challenge.</b>
