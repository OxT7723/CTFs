After navigating to the store, I attempted to purchase the flag but discovered I didnâ€™t have enough funds in my wallet.

To manipulate the wallet balance, I purchased -100000000000 video games. This unexpectedly resulted in my wallet balance increasing to 3,000,000,000,050 dollars. With the increased balance, I played a game of rock-paper-scissors.

After winning, I was awarded the flag and navigated to the "Examine your Inventory" page to view and retrieve the flag: `flag{18bdd83cee5690321bb14c70465d3408}`
