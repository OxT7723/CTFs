**Description:**

<small>Author: @JohnHammond</small><br><br>Uh oh! Mimi forgot her password for her Windows laptop! <br><br> Luckily, she dumped one of the crucial processes running on her computer (don't ask me why, okay)...  can you help her recover her password? <br><br> <b>NOTE: Archive password is <code>mimi</code></b> <br><br> <b>Download the file(s) below.</b><br>


**Category:** Warmups

**Difficulty:** easy

**File:** [mimi.7z](mimi.7z)

## Solution

After downloading the file mimi.7z, I extracted it using the provided password (mimi). The extracted file contained a memory dump, which often holds valuable information for recovering credentials on Windows.

I attempted to use pypykatz, a tool designed to extract credentials from Windows process dumps, but encountered some errors initially. After ensuring that Kali Linux and pypykatz were up-to-date resolved my issue.

After successfully running pypykatz on the memory dump, I was able to extract Mimiâ€™s password, which contained the flag of `flag{7a565a86761a2b89524bf7bb0d19bcea}`
