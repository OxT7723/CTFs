**Category:** Warmups

**Difficulty:** easy

**File:** [Half-Life_3_OST.mp3](Half-Life_3_OST.mp3)

## Solution

Upon running the file command, I discovered that the file was actually a PNG image, despite its misleading name. After renaming the file extension to .png and opening it, I was able to retrieve the flag:
![Half-Life_3_OST.png](Half-Life_3_OST.png)
