# Say Cheese!

**Creator:** makelaris

**Description:** The crew's humanitarian mission attracts the ire of the Enclave, who deploys drones to monitor their efforts. In a stroke of luck, the crew manages to shoot down one of the drones. Seizing the opportunity, they bring the drone back to their workshop and carefully disassemble it. The drone's components are numerous, but the camera stands out as it is a seperate module. Scanning the camera with Nmap reveals it runs Telnet, though it's password-protected. Analyzing the chips, they identify a flash memory similar to the W25Q128 family. The crew's tech specialist examines the device closely. The goal: to hijack the drones and thwart the Enclave's surveillance and attacks.
