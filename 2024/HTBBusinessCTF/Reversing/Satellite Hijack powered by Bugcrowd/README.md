# Satellite Hijack powered by Bugcrowd

**Creator:** makelaris

**Description:** The crew has located a dilapidated pre-war bunker. Deep within, a dusty control panel reveals that it was once used for communication with a low-orbit observation satellite. During the war, actors on all sides infiltrated and hacked each others systems and software, inserting backdoors to cripple or take control of critical machinery. It seems like this panel has been tampered with to prevent the control codes necessary to operate the satellite from being transmitted - can you recover the codes and take control of the satellite to locate enemy factions?<br>
The HTB Business CTF 2024 diamond sponsor, Bugcrowd, will provide the first 100 users to complete the challenge with a swag pack of 1 T-shirt, 1 Sticker, and a BC Fidget.
