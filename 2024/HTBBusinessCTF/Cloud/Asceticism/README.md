**Description:** Upon thorough investigation, we have come across AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) keys within a publicly accessible Git repository. Our initial suspicion is that these keys are associated with Vault11. However, we are seeking further clarification and confirmation on this matter. We kindly request your assistance in delving deeper into the situation to ascertain the precise ownership of these keys and to explore potential strategies for internally addressing any security vulnerabilities they may pose.
