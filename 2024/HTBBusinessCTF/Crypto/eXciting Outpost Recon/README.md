# eXciting Outpost Recon

**Creator:** makelaris

**Description:** Hijacking the outpost responsible for housing the messengers of the core gangs, we have managed to intercept communications between a newly-elected leader and the Tariaki, a well-established and powerful gang. In an attempt to sow conflict and prevent the creation of a singular all-powerful coalition to oppress the common people, we want YOU to use this message to our advantage. Can you use their obsequiousness to your advantage?
