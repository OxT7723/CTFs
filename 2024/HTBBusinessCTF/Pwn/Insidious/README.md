# Insidious

**Creator:** makelaris

**Description:** Old tech was much better. Faster, more powerful, more efficient. But few ever understood how it worked. They delegated responsibility of understanding the world to a select few; that was their downfall. Once the few had gone, what was left? A wealth of technological power - but nobody to understand it. Years passed, and the old tech faded away. Into nothingness. This mission is for the fate of civilisation, but it's also for the pride of the new world. Can you regain what was once lost? Or is the apex of humanity's power and understanding destined to forever be in the past? <br>Note: use <b>nc 37.27.6.39 1337</b> to connect
