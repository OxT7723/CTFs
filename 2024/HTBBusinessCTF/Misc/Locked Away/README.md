**Creator:** makelaris

**Description:** A test! Getting onto the team is one thing, but you must prove your skills to be chosen to represent the best of the best. They have given you the classic - a restricted environment, devoid of functionality, and it is up to you to see what you can do. Can you break open the chest? Do you have what it takes to bring humanity from the brink?
