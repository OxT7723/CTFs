We saw some communication to a sketchy site... here's an export of the network traffic. Can you track it down?

Some tools like rita or zeek might help dig through all of this data!

## Solution 

1. **Installation of RITA:** We installed RITA, a powerful network traffic analysis tool.

2. **Log Analysis:** Using RITA, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the network logs.

3. **Identification of the Suspicious Site:** Through our analysis, we were able to identify the 'sketchy site' responsible for the suspicious traffic.

4. **Further Investigation:** To gather more information and potentially acquire additional evidence, we visited the suspicious site, to find the flag `flag{8626fe7dcd8d412a80d0b3f0e36afd4a}`
