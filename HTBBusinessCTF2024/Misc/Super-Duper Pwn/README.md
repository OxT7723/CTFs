# Super-Duper Pwn!

**Creator:** makelaris

**Description:** In the heart of the desolate wasteland stood a relic of the old world: the last known Super Duper Mart still operational, run entirely by a swarm of self-service robots. Designed as an impenetrable fortress, it preserved food and drinks from a long-gone era. The only interaction with the outside world came from behind a titanium-barred window, where a prototype Bag Boy robot sporadically chirped, "How may I be of assistance today?". For the crew, this store was a beacon of hope amidst the ruins, holding the nuclear goodies they desperately needed for their perilous journey. Short on caps, their only option was to somehow hack the robot. (https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1235600871086358649&scope=bot&permissions=2048)
