# Knock Knock

**Creator:** makelaris

**Description:** During their mission inside Vault 79, the crew inadvertently trips an unmarked sensor not shown on the schematics and blueprints, triggering the Vault's automated defense system. The main and secondary doors slam shut, and the walls begin slowly closing in, threatening to crush the crew inside. With time running out, the crew quickly gathers around the maintenance console, where they have already collected significant information about the custom protocol used on top of Modbus to interact with the PLC controlling the doors. The hackers spring into action, aiming to hijack the session of the operator program that was activated. Can you make it out alive before time runs out?
