# Sneak peek

**Creator:** makelaris

**Description:** As the crew delves into their quest for acetone peroxide, they stumble upon a decrepit bread factory. Intrigued by the potential for cooperation, they approach the factory and meet the Responders faction, composed of settlers, firefighters, police officers, and medics. The Responders agree to trade acetone peroxide in exchange for the crew's help in restoring the factory to full functionality. With the PLCs in hand, the crew sets up a temporary workshop within the factory's maintenance room. The hackers and engineers collaborate to analyze the aged devices, which are layered with outdated but intricate security protocols. They hook one of the PLCs up to their portable workstation and begin the painstaking process of analyzing the custom protocol used to store the password and secret data in it. Their only lead is that the password is stored in the Memory Block of the PLC under an uncrackable MD5 hash.
